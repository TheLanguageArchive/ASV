# ASV: Archive structure browser

ASV (or Metadata Browser) is a web-based application that allows users to browse the content of the
extensive archive of the IMDI (ISLE Metadata Description Initiative) and CMDI ([Component Metadata Infrastructure](http://www.clarin.eu/cmdi)))
corpora at [The Language Archive](http://tla.mpi.nl) of the MPI for Psycholinguistics. 

The main application is [metadata-browser-pages](./metadata-browser-pages). It also contains additional documentation and technical instructions.

**Note for developers**: please push development changes to the `development` branch so that `master` is always stable.
